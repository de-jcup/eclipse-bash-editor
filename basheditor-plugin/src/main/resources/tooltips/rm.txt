Delete (remove) a file or files. The -f option forces removal of even readonly files, 
and is useful for bypassing user input in a script.

Note	
====
The rm command will, by itself, fail to remove filenames beginning with a dash. 
Why? Because rm sees a dash-prefixed filename as an option.

bash$ rm -badname
rm: invalid option -- b
 Try `rm --help' for more information.
One clever workaround is to precede the filename with a " -- " (the end-of-options flag).
bash$ rm -- -badname
Another method to is to preface the filename to be removed with a dot-slash .
bash$ rm ./-badname

Warning
=======	
When used with the recursive flag -r, this command removes files all the way down the directory 
tree from the current directory. A careless rm -rf * can wipe out a big chunk of a directory structure.
