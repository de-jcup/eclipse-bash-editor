Putting a caller command inside a function echoes to stdout information about the caller of that function.

#!/bin/bash

function1 ()
{
  # Inside function1 ().
  caller 0   # Tell me about it.
}

function1    # Line 9 of script.

# 9 main test.sh
# ^                 Line number that the function was called from.
#   ^^^^            Invoked from "main" part of script.
#        ^^^^^^^    Name of calling script.

caller 0     # Has no effect because it's not inside a function.

A caller command can also return caller information from a script sourced within another script. Analogous to a function, this is a "subroutine call."

You may find this command useful in debugging.
