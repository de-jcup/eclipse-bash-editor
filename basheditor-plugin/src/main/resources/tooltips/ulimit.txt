Sets an upper limit on use of system resources. Usually invoked with the -f option, which sets a limit on file size (ulimit -f 1000 limits files to 1 meg maximum). [7] The -t option limits the coredump size (ulimit -c 0 eliminates coredumps). Normally, the value of ulimit would be set in /etc/profile and/or ~/.bash_profile (see Appendix H).

Examples:

---------
Judicious use of ulimit can protect a system against the dreaded fork bomb.

	#!/bin/bash
	# This script is for illustrative purposes only.
	# Run it at your own peril -- it WILL freeze your system.
	
	while true  #  Endless loop.
	do
	  $0 &      #  This script invokes itself . . .
	            #+ forks an infinite number of times . . .
	            #+ until the system freezes up because all resources exhausted.
	done        #  This is the notorious "sorcerer's appentice" scenario.
	
	exit 0      #  Will not exit here, because this script will never terminate.
	
A ulimit -Hu XX (where XX is the user process limit) in /etc/profile would abort this script when it exceeded the preset limit.
