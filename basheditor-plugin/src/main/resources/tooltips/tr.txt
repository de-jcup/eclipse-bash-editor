NAME
       tr - translate or delete characters

SYNOPSIS
       tr [OPTION]... SET1 [SET2]

DESCRIPTION
       Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters from standard input, writ‐
       ing to standard output.

       -c, -C, --complement
              first complement SET1

       -d, --delete
              delete characters in SET1, do not translate

       -s, --squeeze-repeats
              replace each input sequence of  a  repeated  character  that  is
              listed in SET1 with a single occurrence of that character

       -t, --truncate-set1
              first truncate SET1 to length of SET2

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       SETs  are  specified  as  strings  of characters.  Most represent them‐
       selves.  Interpreted sequences are:

       \NNN   character with octal value NNN (1 to 3 octal digits)

       \\     backslash

       \a     audible BEL

       \b     backspace

       \f     form feed

       \n     new line

       \r     return

       \t     horizontal tab

       \v     vertical tab

       CHAR1-CHAR2
              all characters from CHAR1 to CHAR2 in ascending order

       [CHAR*]
              in SET2, copies of CHAR until length of SET1

       [CHAR*REPEAT]
              REPEAT copies of CHAR, REPEAT octal if starting with 0

       [:alnum:]
              all letters and digits

       [:alpha:]
              all letters

       [:blank:]
              all horizontal whitespace

       [:cntrl:]
              all control characters

       [:digit:]
              all digits

       [:graph:]
              all printable characters, not including space

       [:lower:]
              all lower case letters

       [:print:]
              all printable characters, including space

       [:punct:]
              all punctuation characters

       [:space:]
              all horizontal or vertical whitespace

       [:upper:]
              all upper case letters

       [:xdigit:]
              all hexadecimal digits

       [=CHAR=]
              all characters which are equivalent to CHAR

       Translation occurs if -d is not given and both SET1  and  SET2  appear.
       -t  may  be  used only when translating.  SET2 is extended to length of
       SET1 by repeating its last character as necessary.   Excess  characters
       of  SET2  are  ignored.  Only [:lower:] and [:upper:] are guaranteed to
       expand in ascending order; used in SET2  while  translating,  they  may
       only  be used in pairs to specify case conversion.  -s uses SET1 if not
       translating nor deleting; else squeezing uses  SET2  and  occurs  after
       translation or deletion.
