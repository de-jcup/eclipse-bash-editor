$BASH_VERSION
<br><br>
The version of Bash installed on the system
<div class='example'>
bash$ echo $BASH_VERSION
3.2.25(1)-release
</div>
But on another shell - e.g. TCSH:	      
<div class='example'>
tcsh% echo $BASH_VERSION
BASH_VERSION: Undefined variable.
</div>
	      
Checking $BASH_VERSION is a good method of determining which shell is running. $SHELL does not necessarily give the correct answer.
