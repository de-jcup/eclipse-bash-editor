cat, an acronym for concatenate, lists a file to stdout. 
When combined with redirection (> or >>), it is commonly used to concatenate files.

Options:
========
The -n option to cat inserts consecutive numbers before all lines of the target file(s). 
The -b option numbers only the non-blank lines. 
The -v option echoes nonprintable characters, using ^ notation. 
The -s option squeezes multiple consecutive blank lines into a single blank line.

Examples:
=========  
# Uses of 'cat'
cat filename                          # Lists the file.

cat file.1 file.2 file.3 > file.123   # Combines three files into one.
