The standard UNIX archiving utility. [1] Originally a Tape ARchiving program, it has developed into a general purpose package that can handle all manner of archiving with all types of destination devices, ranging from tape drives to regular files to even stdout (see Example 3-4). GNU tar has been patched to accept various compression filters, for example: tar czvf archive_name.tar.gz *, which recursively archives and gzips all files in a directory tree except dotfiles in the current working directory ($PWD). [2]

Some useful tar options:
========================
-c create (a new archive)

-x extract (files from existing archive)

--delete delete (files from existing archive)

	Caution:
	========
	This option will not work on magnetic tape devices.

-r append (files to existing archive)

-A append (tar files to existing archive)

-t list (contents of existing archive)

-u update archive

-d compare archive with specified filesystem

--after-date only process files with a date stamp after specified date

-z gzip the archive

(compress or uncompress, depending on whether combined with the -c or -x) option

-j bzip2 the archive

	Caution:
	========
	It may be difficult to recover data from a corrupted gzipped tar archive. When archiving important files, make multiple backups.
