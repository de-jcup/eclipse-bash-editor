Specifies an action on receipt of a signal; also useful for debugging.

A signal is a message sent to a process, either by the kernel or another process, telling it to take some specified action (usually to terminate). For example, hitting a Control-C sends a user interrupt, an INT signal, to a running program.

A simple instance:
trap '' 2
# Ignore interrupt 2 (Control-C), with no action specified. 

trap 'echo "Control-C disabled."' 2
# Message when Control-C pressed.
