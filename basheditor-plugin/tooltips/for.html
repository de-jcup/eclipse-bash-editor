for
<br><br>
The syntax of the for command is:

<div class='example'>
    for NAME [in WORDS ... ] ; do COMMANDS; done
</div>

Execute commands for each member in a list.<br>
<br>
The `for' loop executes a sequence of commands for each member in a
list of items.  If `in WORDS ...;' is not present, then `in "$@"' is
assumed.  For each element in WORDS, NAME is set to that element, and
the COMMANDS are executed.<br>
<br>
Exit Status:<br>
Returns the status of the last command executed.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<div class='example'>
 #!/bin/bash
 echo "print some strings:"
 for NAME in 'Albert' 'Tregnaghi' ; do echo "name=${NAME}"; done
 
 echo "print some numbers:"
 for i in 0 1 2 3 ; do echo "number=$i"; done
</div>

<br><br>
An alternate form of the for command is also supported:
<br><br>
<div class='example'>
for (( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3 )) ; do commands ; done
</div>
First, the arithmetic expression expr1 is evaluated according to the rules described below (see Shell Arithmetic). The arithmetic expression expr2 is then evaluated repeatedly until it evaluates to zero. Each time expr2 evaluates to a non-zero value, commands are executed and the arithmetic expression expr3 is evaluated. If any expression is omitted, it behaves as if it evaluates to 1. The return value is the exit status of the last command in commands that is executed, or false if any of the expressions is invalid.

The break and continue builtins may be used to control loop execution.
