This is the file copy command. cp file1 file2 copies file1 to file2, overwriting file2 if it already exists.

Tip	
===
Particularly useful are  
	- the -a archive flag (for copying an entire directory tree), 
	- the -u update flag (which prevents overwriting identically-named newer files), and 
	- the -r and -R recursive flags.

cp -u source_dir/* dest_dir
#  "Synchronize" dest_dir to source_dir
#+  by copying over all newer and not previously existing files.
