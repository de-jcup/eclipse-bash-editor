NAME
    cd - Change the shell working directory.

SYNOPSIS
    cd [-L|-P] [dir]

DESCRIPTION
    Change the shell working directory.
    
    Change the current directory to DIR.  The default DIR is the value of the
    HOME shell variable.
    
    The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing
    DIR.  Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:).
    A null directory name is the same as the current directory.  If DIR begins
    with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used.
    
    If the directory is not found, and the shell option `cdable_vars' is set,
    the word is assumed to be  a variable name.  If that variable has a value,
    its value is used for DIR.
    
    Options:
        -L	force symbolic links to be followed
        -P	use the physical directory structure without following symbolic
    	links
    
    The default is to follow symbolic links, as if `-L' were specified.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns 0 if the directory is changed; non-zero otherwise.
