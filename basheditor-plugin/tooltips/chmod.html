Changes the attributes of an existing file or directory.
<br>
<h3>Command syntax</h3>
<p><code>chmod [options] mode[,mode] file1 [file2 ...]</code></p>
<p>Usual implemented options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>-R</tt> recursive, i.e. include objects in subdirectories</li>
<li><tt>-f</tt> force, forge ahead with all objects even if errors occur</li>
<li><tt>-v</tt> verbose, show objects processed</li>
</ul>
<h3>Octal notation of file system permissions</h3>
<p>The main parts of the chmod permissions:</p>
<p>Example: drwxrwx---</p>
<p>To the right of the "d":</p>
<p>the left three characters rwx define permissions of the OWNER.</p>
<p>the middle three characters rwx define permissions of the GROUP.</p>
<p>the right three characters --- define permissions of EVERYONE ELSE. In this example EVERYONE ELSE has no permissions.</p>
<p><br/>
The <tt>chmod</tt> numerical format accepts up to four octal digits. The three rightmost digits refer to permissions for the file owner, the group, and other users. The optional leading digit, when 4 digits are given, specifies the special <tt>setuid</tt>, <tt>setgid,</tt> and <tt>sticky</tt> flags.</p>

<h3>Some examples:</h3>
<div class='example'>
chmod +x filename
# Makes "filename" executable for all users.

chmod u+s filename
# Sets "suid" bit on "filename" permissions.
# An ordinary user may execute "filename" with same privileges as the file's owner.
# (This does not apply to shell scripts.)


chmod 644 filename
#  Makes "filename" readable/writable to owner, readable to others
#+ (octal mode).

chmod 444 filename
#  Makes "filename" read-only for all.
#  Modifying the file (for example, with a text editor)
#+ not allowed for a user who does not own the file (except for root),
#+ and even the file owner must force a file-save
#+ if she modifies the file.
#  Same restrictions apply for deleting the file.

chmod 1777 directory-name
#  Gives everyone read, write, and execute permission in directory,
#+ however also sets the "sticky bit".
#  This means that only the owner of the directory,
#+ owner of the file, and, of course, root
#+ can delete any particular file in that directory.

chmod 111 directory-name
#  Gives everyone execute-only permission in a directory.
#  This means that you can execute and READ the files in that directory
#+ (execute permission necessarily includes read permission
#+ because you can't execute a file without being able to read it).
#  But you can't list the files or search for them with the "find" command.
#  These restrictions do not apply to root.

chmod 000 directory-name
#  No permissions at all for that directory.
#  Can't read, write, or execute files in it.
#  Can't even list files in it or "cd" to it.
#  But, you can rename (mv) the directory
#+ or delete it (rmdir) if it is empty.
#  You can even symlink to files in the directory,
#+ but you can't read, write, or execute the symlinks.
#  These restrictions do not apply to root.
