Terminfo (formerly Termcap) is a database of terminal capabilities and more. 
- For every (well almost) model of terminal it tells application programs what the terminal is capable of doing. 
- It tells what escape sequences (or control characters) to send to the terminal in order to do things such as 
  - move the cursor to a new location, 
  - erase part of the screen, 
  - scroll the screen, 
  - change modes, 
  - change appearance (colors, brightness, blinking, underlining, reverse video etc.). 
  
After about 1980, many terminals supported over a hundred different commands (some of which take numeric parameters).

One way in which terminfo gives the its information to an application program is via the "ncurses" functions that a 
programmer may put into a C program. 

For example, if a program wants to move the cursor to row 3, col 6 it simply calls: move(3,6). 
The move() function (part of ncurses) knows how to do this for your terminal (it has read terminfo). 
So it sends the appropriate escape sequence to the terminal to make this particular move for a certain terminal. 
Some programs get info directly from a terminfo files without using ncurses. 
Thus a Linux package that doesn't require ncurses may still need a terminfo file for your terminal.

The terminfo abbreviations are usually longer than those of termcap and thus it's easier to guess what they mean. 
The manual pages for terminfo are more detailed (and include the old termcap abbreviations). 
Also, the termcap entries had a size limitation which is not present for terminfo. 
Thus, unless you are already committed to working with termcap, it's suggested you use terminfo.
