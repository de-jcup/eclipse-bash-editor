	<h3>Save actions</h3>
	<p>
		You can define in "<code>Window->Preferences->Bash editor</code>" what shall happen when
		a bash file is saved <i>(currently only external source formatter is supported)</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<h4>External source reformatter action</h4>
		If enabled the editor will always save the editor content, call the external tool and reloads the file into editor again, so the
		formatting changes will be applied.<br>
		<br>
		Per default this option is disabled but has a working default setup for <code>beautysh</code>.
		The installation for <code>beautysh</code> is described at <a href="https://github.com/bemeurer/beautysh">beautysh GitHub</a>. 
		But of course you can use any external source code formatter of your choice! Just call your tool with <code>$filename</code> as variable for the edit file path
		inside your given command line in preferences and it shall work.
